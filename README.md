# 🧠 Recurrent Neural Network and LSTM from Scratch

This repository demonstrates how to implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model from scratch using only **NumPy**. The goal is to provide an educational foundation for understanding the low-level mechanics of these fundamental deep learning architectures.
